  /**
   * verifyProfileSaved
   *
   * Purpose:
   *  - Checks if the text or toast "Profile details saved" appears on the page,
   *    which indicates that the profile update was successful.
   *  - Once visible, it waits for 10 seconds to allow any background processes,
   *    animations, or subsequent auto-navigation to complete safely.
   *  - Returns `true` if the confirmation text is found within the timeout window,
   *    otherwise returns `false`.
   *
   * This function is designed for use at the end of the profile update flow to confirm success.
   *
   * @param {number} timeout - Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the toast/text to appear. Default is 10000 ms (10s).
   * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - Resolves to true if the text appears within the timeout, false otherwise.
